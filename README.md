### üí° Key Takeaway
Today I learned how Python can store information, perform simple calculations, and interact with users by asking for input.

# Day 15. Expense Tracker (My first working project.)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that tracks daily expenses and saves them to a text file.  
It demonstrates Python concepts up to **file handling**, including:

- Variables and Data Types  
- Loops and Conditional Statements  
- Functions  
- Lists and Dictionaries  
- File Handling (read/write operations)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Run the Python script
3. Enter your expenses and view them saved in `expenses.txt`
